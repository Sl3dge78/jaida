# To consider
- [ ] Make the key bob up & down
- [ ] Make the characters bob up & down?
- [ ] Save state: When we destroy the bushes, they come back
- [ ] Quest tracker of sorts (not necessarily UI)
- [ ] Save entities in maps, separate entity file. Need to parse it. Reflection on structs.
- [ ] Better audio system, using the callback. 
    - (Dialog) queue x blipblips
- [ ] Have some components that update not every frame
- [ ] (Collision) Allow definition of a custom collision box, for some map tiles.
- [ ] Pathfinding ?
