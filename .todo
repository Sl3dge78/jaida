# To consider
- [ ] Ranged human?
- [ ] Visual effects?
- [ ] Some "particles" to add life
- [ ] Projectile entity type?
- [ ] Dungeon 
    - [ ] Puzzles
- [ ] Make the key bob up & down
- [ ] Make the characters bob up & down? Could look better
- [ ] Save state: When we destroy the bushes, they come back. -> Meh
- [ ] Save entities in maps, separate entity file. Need to parse it. Reflection on structs. -> Doesn't seem needed yet
- [ ] Better audio system, using the callback. 
    - (Dialog) queue x blipblips
- [ ] Have some components that update not every frame -> Doesn't seem needed yet
- [ ] (Collision) Allow definition of a custom collision box, for some map tiles.
- [ ] Pathfinding ?

# Done

- [X] (Collision) Detect them with NPCs

- [X] Entities stay alive for 1 frame when changing map. Maybe do the map change at the end of the frame to prevent that?
